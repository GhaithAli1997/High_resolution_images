Faces and Car Plates Detection with YOLOv8x
This repository comprises code for detecting faces and car license plates within extremely high-resolution images using YOLOv8x. The project addresses the challenges associated with limited training resources by implementing a cascaded detection strategy, utilizing YOLOv8x's ability to detect persons and cars within images of 7046x3523 resolution.

Features:
Utilization of YOLOv8x for detecting persons and cars in high-resolution images.
Cascaded detection approach using bounding boxes from YOLOv8x for face and car plate detection.
Accommodation for images at a resolution of 7046x3523.
